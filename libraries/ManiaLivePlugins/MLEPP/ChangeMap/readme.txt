The plugin works as follows:
1) With the command /map <part_of_map_name>. The <part_of_map_name> parameter must be part of the map name case-insensitive.
2) With the command /maps a window opens with the current map list. There are 'Change map' buttons next to every map, which pressed change to the map.

This plugin works only as part of MLEPP for Shootmania (mlepp.trackmania.nl)
